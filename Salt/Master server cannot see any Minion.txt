Issue:

When you set up a Salt Master server and several Minions, you may find that none of minions could be seen by master. 


nc -v -z salt.master.ip.addr 4505
nc: connect to 10.61.22.98 port 4505 (tcp) failed: No route to host





Reason:

The firewall on Salt Master might block the incoming request from minions.

 

Solution:

Invoke following command on Master server to change firewall policy. 

lokkit -p 22:tcp -p 4505:tcp -p 4506:tcp
